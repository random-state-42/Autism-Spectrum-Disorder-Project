# Autism Risk Detection Using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the risk level of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** in individuals based on their responses to a screening questionnaire. It uses a trained machine learning model to classify responses into risk categories (e.g., Mild, Moderate, Severe) and offers precautionary advice accordingly.

## Project Overview

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder affecting communication and behavior. Early detection can help in timely intervention. This project uses a dataset of screening questions to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying individuals at risk.

 **Problem**: Lack of early diagnosis can delay interventions for ASD.
 **Solution**: Use ML to automate ASD risk classification based on questionnaire responses.
 **Output**: Predicted risk level + suggested precautions.
